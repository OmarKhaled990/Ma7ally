Nowadays, it is no secret that the Economy has been heavily impacted by the
restrictions on the import business in Egypt which has affected the
availability of the imported goods that consumers desire. As a result, the
local brands are facing a significant challenge to compensate for the lack of
supply which puts them in a position where they need to thrive more in
order to satisfy the demand of the consumers, gain more significant market
share and recognition.
